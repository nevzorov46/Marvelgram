Under "Explore more" header there is a horizontally scrollable list of 10 characters other than currently opened one. 
I picked up them randomly from the source list. 
When a user tapp on any of suggested characters opens their own page with description and "Explore more" suggestions.



Also there is a search bar and a user can search chararter by name:
